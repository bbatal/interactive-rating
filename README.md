# Interactive Rating: simple rating feedback form

## Description

A simple form with subtle css animations and a response view showing the users selected choice. It is built with only HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Targeting the value of the checked state on form submission and setting it back to a default (false) state was the primary challenge.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

In the project directory: 

### `clone repo`

### `open in browser/ use live-server`

## Reflection

This interactive form was a way to test how close I could get the initial design with all colors, fonts, sizing, and css animation timing. This app gives users a pleasant experience when completing a form in order to hopefully finish it. It was coded entirely from scratch, with just a style guide to accompany it. I learned a lot about organizing CSS using variables (for colors on the :root selector), keeping the javascript neat by pseudo coding and defining variables first, and splitting up the html with comments
